Dual Conditional Normalization Pyramid Network for Face Photo-Sketch Synthesis
## DCNP

Pytorch Code for "Dual Conditional Normalization Pyramid Network for Face Photo-Sketch Synthesis".

Code is coming soon!

### Requirements

+ Ubuntu 18.04
+ Anaconda (Python, Numpy, PIL, etc.)
+ PyTorch 1.7.1
+ torchvision 0.8.2


### Results

Our final results can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iLesbjhFp5oYkOTSKzwgO_wUvTZ61Z9-/view?usp=sharing).

### Evaluation

Matlab is requested to compute the FSIM metrics in [compute_fsim.m](https://github.com/Tony0720/Dual-Conditional-Normalization-Pyramid-Network-for-Face-Photo-Sketch-Synthesis/blob/main/compute_fsim.m).

The evaluation of FID can be referred to [here](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid).

The evaluation of LPIPS can be referred to [here](https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity).

### Acknowledgments

This code builds heavily on **[pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)**. Thanks for open-sourcing!
